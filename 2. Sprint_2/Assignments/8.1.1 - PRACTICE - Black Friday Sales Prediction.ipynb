The main idea is to be able to generate a predictor that allows us to predict the `purchase amount`.\n","\n","In order to achieve a good predictor we must apply the different concepts that we have been learning:\n","\n","* `Exploration`\n","* `Feature Engineering`\n","* `Modeling`\n","* `Evaluation`\n","\n","The dataset here is a sample of the transactions made in a retail store. The store wants to know better the customer `purchase` behaviour against different products. The problem is a `regression problem` where we are trying to predict the dependent variable (the amount of purchase) with the help of the information contained in the other variables.\n","\n","### You
